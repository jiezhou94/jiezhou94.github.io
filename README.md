## About me

I am going to join Amazon as a research scientist in July 2021. I am now a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Management Science at University of Miami advised by Prof. 
[Will Wei Sun](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~sun244/) and Prof. [Jingfei Zhang](https://people.miami.edu/profile/ezhang@bus.miami.edu). Before joining University of Miami, I received my B.S. degree in Statistics at University of Science and Technology of China in 2016.

My research interests focus on the tensor learning and multi-armed bandits. 

My email is jiezhoumao@gmail.com.
